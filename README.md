# Chaos-in-Non-Markovian-Optomechanical-Systems
This library includes Wolf's algorithm to calculate maximal Lyapunov exponent (LE), referencing link:https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48084-wolf-lyapunov-exponent-estimation-from-a-time-series

Here we study chaos in Non-Markovian Optomechanical Systems using the post-Markov approximation and Wolf's algorithm to calculate Lyapunov exponents.
All the .m files need to be put in the same folder.

Phase_SC_Post_Markov.m gives the phase diagram.

Bifurcation_LE.m gives the bifurcation diagram with corresponding LE.

LE_parfor.m gives the chaos landscape in phase space P-\Delta, based on LE.

f_function_plot.m gives the f_i non-Markovian coefficients plot.
